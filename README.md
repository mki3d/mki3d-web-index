# mki3d-web-index
An index of links to the web of [MKI3D](https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d/) stages 
designed with  [MKI3D MODELER](https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d/mki3d_www/mki3d.html) 
that can be browsed with [MKI3D TRAVEL](https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d/mki3d_www/travel.html).

If you want to have a link to your stage or web of stages on the index, then submit an issue containing the URL in 
the form of the following example:

https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d/mki3d_www/travel.html?input=https://mki1967.github.io/mki3d-data/data/web/stage2.mki3d

After testing the link I will add it to the list.
